Being a full-stack developer has exposed me to a broad range of useful ideas. I enjoy taking ownership of the full software lifecycle, from prototype to deployment. I'm visually oriented and know how to implement business requirements on the front-end as a HTML Javascript application and also on the server-side with micro-services. As a polyglot, I know when to use the right tools for the job. The best SaaS API integration may mean using either Go, Node, Java or C# .Net in a cloud or on-premise environment. I've used AI and machine learning to implement document imaging, recognition, and text extraction algorithms for the financial industry. I've improved operational efficiency of organizations by improving build and deployment workflows using continuous delivery tools such as TeamCity, Jenkins, Kubernetes and Docker.
