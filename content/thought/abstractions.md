> [Computational thinking](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/papers.html) means creating and making use of different levels of abstraction, to understand and solve problems more effectively.

> Everything is a [layer of abstraction](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/PleaseLearnToThinkAboutAbstractions.aspx) over something else. New technology is built upon older technology. I push a button on my Prius and the car starts. No need even for a key in the ignition. A hundred plus years of internal combustion abstracted away to a simple push button.
