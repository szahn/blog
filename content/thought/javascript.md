That's why it's important to understand how different languages solve problems differently (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/15-easy-solutions-data-frame-problems-r). To learn a new ways of reasoning about software, learn new programming languages with different styles like functional, and dynamically typed languages such as Javascript.

Running javascript through a transpiler like Typescript (http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is highly recommended to improve code quality. Typescript added strong typing at compile time and introduces ES6-like class syntax which allows for a mix of object oriented and functional programming
