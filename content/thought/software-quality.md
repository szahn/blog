Software Quality: There are known software quality attributes such as performance and maintainability but good software quality is really achieved not by adding more features but removing just enough features. Since quality is ultimately measured by the user experience (http://wiki.c2.com/?DoesSoftwareQualityMeanNoBugs), what matter is how easy it is for the user to accomplish a task.
