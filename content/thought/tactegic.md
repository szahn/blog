I first heard about the word Tactegic from this blog post (https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/who-needs-architects-when-tactics-do-not-add-up-to-strategy/). Without focus, lots of little tactical successes can breed strategic defeat. When it comes to programming, the word hacking seems related to this idea. When you're hacking away, you're usually taking as many shortcuts as you can, and fumbling your way towards some kind of ad-hoc fix. Hacking can be good with a degree of focus and strategy. In fact, some hacks may lead to actual products in the end. One possible benefit of hacking is doing away with over-engineering and over-design, however, one should eventually step back and be critical about ones own work.
