      <description>Work hard and God will prosper you. Financial Prosperity is often connected to Soul Prosperity A man must do what he can to provide for his family Trials develop your character, preparing you for increased blessings Take responsibility for problems that are the result of your own bad decisions. Don&amp;rsquo;t displace the blame. See challenges as stepping stones, not as obstacles. Be meek before God, but bold before men. (In other words, be assertive but not aggressive).</description>
