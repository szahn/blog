      <description>There may come a time when you stumble upon an ancient SVN repository nested with multiple projects and need to efficiently collaborate with others on a single project in that repository. Well, we all know Git is better than SVN in many ways. It&amp;rsquo;s faster and the decentralized, distributed nature of Git provides better security and redundancy.

      <title>Using DotNetNuke (DNN) CMS</title>

      <description>DotNetNuke is a CMS in which I do a lot of web development in. For anyone that wants to get into DNN module development, below is an simple action plan to help get their feet wet.
ReviewÂ UX Design Guidelines. Remember that each version of DNN varies in its standards and guidelines. Since comprehensive documentation is hard to find for each version, do your best to support at least one major version.</description>
