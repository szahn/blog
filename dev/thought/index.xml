      <description>When all you have is a hammer, everything can be hammered down. But not every problem needs to be solved with a hammer. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how different languages solve problems differently (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/15-easy-solutions-data-frame-problems-r). To learn a new ways of reasoning about software, learn new programming languages with different styles like functional, and dynamically typed languages such as Javascript.
JavaScript is an excellent language to learn new ways of thinking, building and deploying software.</description>

      <title>Software Quality</title>

      <description>Software Quality: There are known software quality attributes such as performance and maintainability but good software quality is really achieved not by adding more features but removing just enough features. Since quality is ultimately measured by the user experience (http://wiki.c2.com/?DoesSoftwareQualityMeanNoBugs), what matter is how easy it is for the user to accomplish a task.</description>

      <description>I first heard about the word Tactegic from this blog post (https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/who-needs-architects-when-tactics-do-not-add-up-to-strategy/). Without focus, lots of little tactical successes can breed strategic defeat. When it comes to programming, the word hacking seems related to this idea. When you&amp;rsquo;re hacking away, you&amp;rsquo;re usually taking as many shortcuts as you can, and fumbling your way towards some kind of ad-hoc fix. Hacking can be good with a degree of focus and strategy. In fact, some hacks may lead to actual products in the end.</description>
